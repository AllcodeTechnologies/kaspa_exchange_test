You Will get your Task in kaspa_controller.js file. I want you to modify the sendKaspa Api. This Api is Working Currently But only when the sending amount is matching with fee (I am not sure about it). All i need from you is an api to send Kaspa Coin from my Wallet to Another Kaspa Address. You have to work in such a way that i can send less than 0.1 Kaspa. By The Way i want to send 0.009 KAS at a time.

Basically you need to check 0. You have to work on sendKaspa api

1. Automate The Fee Calculation
2. Code The Api in such a way that i can send 0.009 KAS, or if not possible to send 0.009 Kas, make it any amount lower Than 0.1 KAS. Ofcourse i will be sending more than 0.1 KAS also but i dont think that will be a problem
3. I am not saying modify the code i have shared. I just need the api, do whatever you like .
4. I will provide you the Coin For Testing.
